Movie Recommender System
Description
This project is a Movie Recommender System built using data from the TMDB (The Movie Database) 5000 dataset. The system recommends movies similar to a given movie by analyzing their metadata, including movie ID, name, overview, genre, cast, keywords, and crew. By creating tags from the genre, cast, keywords, and crew information, the project utilizes sentence transformers for vectorization and calculates cosine similarity to find and recommend the top 5 movies similar to the selected movie. The project is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

Folder Structure
movie-recommender-system.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for creating the movie recommender system. It includes the data preprocessing steps, vectorization, and similarity calculation.
tmdb_5000_credits.csv: The dataset containing movie credits (e.g., cast and crew information) used in the recommender system.
tmdb_5000_movies.csv: The dataset containing detailed movie metadata (e.g., movie names, overviews, genres) used in the recommender system.
app.py: The Streamlit application script that serves the movie recommender system as a web app.

Installation Instructions

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/saadkhannust/movie-recommender-system.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd movie-recommender-system

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Code
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Open the movie-recommender-system.ipynb to explore the data processing and model creation steps.

Run the Streamlit application:
use these commands to run the app:
!curl https://loca.lt/mytunnelpassword #This is the password if asked use this
!streamlit run app.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501 --subdomain=myuniquesubdomain

streamlit run app.py

The app will start in your browser, allowing you to input a movie and receive recommendations.
